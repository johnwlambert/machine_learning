## py-loransac

This is a stripped down version of COLMAP that includes only Fundamental matrix, Essential matrix, and homography estimators. It provides a Python wrapper over COLMAP, exposing the high-performance LORANSAC estimators used in COLMAP.

Its advantage of similar libraries such as `pycolmap` is that installation does not require a system-wide COLMAP, which can be cumbersome across platforms.
